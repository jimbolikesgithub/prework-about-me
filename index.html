      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My name is James Edwards, a 20 year old student who will become a software engineer 
         later this year. I currently live in Newnan, Georgia.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Simi Valley, California</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy history, literature, and language.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Software Engineer</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Newnan, Georgia</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to program because it challenges myself and my sense of creativity. To me,
         programming is like an art that demands you to unleash a creative side of yourself that
         you may or may not believe had existed previously. You get to work with people who can help
         show you just how creative your skills can become, along with the hopeful prospect that you,
         too, can aid another in a similar fashion. Programming allows you to converse with those who
         might share your same conviction. It makes me happy to know that I can become more creative,
         and that there are people out there with greater skill and aptitude in regards to computer
         science than myself. These are the type of individuals I could gain from, and in return share 
         my experiences with others. I enjoy the feeling that comes with accomplishing a goal which may 
         seem too far out; one that has you stumped until the answer is finally made aware. All of this
         is a constant challenge to my confidence and comfort. I am no where near the level of skill
         that I aspire to have; I'm still very much a novice. My goal is to become the best in this field -
         not for others, but for myself - so that I can continue to be challenged as technology progresses 
         to newfound heights (which seems to happen at an incredible rate all around us). There's an 
         interpersonal connection that I've been afforded throughout the process that has brought me to this answer.

      <p>Also, it pays well. lol.</p>
